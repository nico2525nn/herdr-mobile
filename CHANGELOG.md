# Changelog

## 1.0.0 — 2026-10-06

Initial MVP.

**App**

- Home: workspace cards with status dots, condensed paths, peer tab chips (never
  fake-selected), offline/stale banners, per-workspace recomposition.
- Terminal: compact workspace/tab rails with horizontal overflow, `+` new-tab action,
  Canvas-rendered ANSI terminal (256-colour, truecolour, alt screen, CJK wide chars,
  scrollback, selection, pinch zoom), Extra Keys panel (Termux default layout, CTRL/ALT
  latch), CJK pre-composition panel (compose → commit → send as UTF-8).
- Settings: M3 grouped lists for Appearance, Connection (SSH profiles + key import,
  direct tailnet URL, per-kind connection test), Terminal, Notifications toggles.
- Transports: SSH tunnel (key auth, host-key verification, loopback forward) and direct.
- Secrets in Android Keystore (AES-256-GCM); values in DataStore; i18n en/ja.
- Notifications for done/blocked/failed transitions with workspace/tab deep links.

**Daemon (`daemon/`)**

- Herdr Unix-socket client, snapshot cache with revision/seq, narrow event subscription
  with `snapshot.required` invalidation, terminal attach via
  `herdr terminal session control`, full `/v1` REST + WebSocket API, bearer auth,
  systemd-ready, secret-free logs.

**Verified**

- `cargo test` (14), JVM unit tests (65), `:app:lintDebug`, emulator install with live
  data: Home cards, Terminal ANSI render, Extra Keys labels, CJK panel, connection test,
  terminal input round-trip on a scratch workspace.

**Deferred to physical hardware**

- IME composition feel, keyboard-driven resize, haptics, Doze/background, Tailscale/SSH
  over real networks, OEM behaviour, high-refresh rendering.
